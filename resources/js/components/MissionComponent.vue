     <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">How it all Began</h2>
     <p class="lead">It all started with a personal realization: the beauty and wisdom of Islam often remain hidden from those who don’t speak Arabic. As someone who has witnessed the transformative power of understanding our faith, I couldn’t stand idly by.</p>
     <p class="lead">I felt a strong calling to create a space where everyone—whether you're a curious soul exploring Islam or a new Muslim finding your way—could access the Quran and its teachings in a language that resonates with them.</p>

     <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold">Our Vision for the Future</h2>
     <p class="lead">I have big dreams for Islamic Connect! I envision expanding our offerings to include even more in-depth resources, collaborating with scholars and educators who can enrich our content.</p>
     <p class="lead">I want to introduce premium features that provide personalized learning experiences and exclusive materials for our registered users. Moreover, I’m committed to partnering with Islamic institutes and organizations to support their educational missions and outreach efforts.</p>
